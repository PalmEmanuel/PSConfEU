## Building robust CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Apps and custom automation

Maybe you've gotten your GitHub workflows, actions and pipelines working. They're triggering on changes on the main branch and you can start them manually if needed. What's next?

Someone creates an issue and you want it to be duplicated to another private repository? What if your own module responded with a comment to the creator of a pull request as its own user? It's all possible!

Let's together have a look at how we can register an app on GitHub and start automating various tasks in our repositories, securely!

In this session we're going to go from an empty repository to a multi-repository structure of pipelines that affect each other using the powers of GitHub Apps and the principle of least privilege, without needing any personal access tokens.
